edit my timelapse video taken with octoprint

I made this video to get my timelapse videos a little more fancy for youtube without too much effort everytime using UI based movie makers.

This script uses moviepy for video editing. 

Example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snzgwYXz8sA


Features
* shows machine type in intro scene (-m)
* shows thingiverse number in intro scene (-t)
* add background music loop (-s)
* fade in and fade out

Plans:
* REST interface to thingiverse to get pictures of makes and thingis to add to video automatically
